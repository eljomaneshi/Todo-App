# Todo-App

This is a TODO CRUD Application (both frontend and back-end). I have developed some features like:

• User Authentication: It allows users to register/login and manage their accounts data and credentials.

• Create and Update tasks: Users can add or modify existing tasks, such as updating the title/description, notes, target date.

• Delete tasks: Allow users to remove tasks from their to-do list.

• Mark tasks as complete.

The back-end is made using Java language, and front-end with React.js (HTML, CSS, JS). 
MYSQL is used as a database. Docker is used to spin off MYSQL database images.
